# Titanic Dataset - EDA Summary

## Key Features:
- `Sex`: Strong indicator of survival — females survived more.
- `Pclass`: First class passengers had higher survival rates.
- `Age`: Related to survival, but contains missing values.
- `Fare`: Higher fare often linked with better survival.

## Missing Values:
- Age: Some missing values.
- Cabin: Too many missing values — might be dropped.
- Embarked: Few missing values — can be filled.

## Outliers:
- `Fare` has large outliers — seen in boxplot.
- `Age` has a few unusually high values.

## Skewed/Imbalanced Features:
- `Sex`: Slightly more males than females.
- `Survived`: Imbalanced — more people did not survive (0).

## Relationships with Target (`Survived`):
- Higher survival rate for females.
- Higher class passengers survived more.
- Children (young age) had better survival.

## Next Steps:
- Impute missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`)
- Drop or engineer `Cabin`
- Consider feature engineering: extract `Title` from `Name`
